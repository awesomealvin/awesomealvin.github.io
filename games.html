                        <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">C++, SDL</h5>

                        <h5 class="mt-4">What is it?</h5>
                        <p>JA2DPSG is a 2D platformer shooter game where the play must shoot their way through 10
                            levels of enemies. The game had a much bigger vision where there were more weapons, more
                            complex combat system and smarter AI. But in the end due to slackness, the game only had
                            one weapon with infinite ammunition which is the only thing that can deal damage. Weapon
                            throwing and picking up is implemented, where thrown weapons were supposed to kill, but now
                            serves as nothing but a cool physics object.
                        </p>

                </div>
                <h5>Main Features and Implementation</h5>
                <h5 class="text-muted">Box2D</h5>
                <p>I wanted the game to be a physics-based game, mostly because I just really love physics in games so
                    I decided to implement Box2D into game. I haven’t developed anything using Box2D before, except for
                    game engines that uses Box2D as their physics engine, but all the code was already done for it, so
                    having to learn Box2D from scratch took a long time, but it was worth it. I used many resources
                    such as the official documentation, forums and YouTube videos, but the one that helped me the most
                    was iforce2d.net (iforce2d, 2011) where the author has a lot of tutorials and guides for different
                    aspects of Box2D..</p>
                <h5 class="text-muted">Movement</h5>
                <p>Movement was done by applying a linear impulse to the object. The force applied was calculated by
                    subtracting the current object’s velocity with the max movement speed. This was necessary so that
                    the object won’t gradually increase speed overtime and will have constant speed instead. This is
                    similar to just setting the object’s velocity but will feel smoother as there will the speed will
                    gradually change from zero to its max speed. The friction of the object also needed a lot of
                    tweaking to get the feel that I wanted.</p>

                <h5 class="text-muted">Object Pooling</h5>
                <p>The shooting direction is calculated by taking the current mouse position and subtracting it with
                    the player’s position. This gives a direction vector that is normalized and multiplied with a force
                    value which is then passed into the apply linear impulse function of the body of the bullet object.
                    The bullet object is physics object with the isBullet enabled on its body so that it uses
                    continuous collision detection. The bullet’s rotation is set to be the same as its velocity, until
                    it is collided with an object. This sets it to be decayable where the alpha value will linear
                    interpolate to zero, then will disable itself. </p>

                <h5 class="text-muted">Gore Effects</h5>
                <p>The gore effects of the enemy use a mix of animated sprites, particle effects, physics objects and
                    gore sounds. The particle effects consisted of two different shades of red, and applies a simple
                    explosive effect. The physics objects consist of 5 objects. The head and the 4 corners of the
                    enemy’s body. When the bullet collides with the enemy, the enemy is despawned and the gore effects
                    are applied. The body parts are roughly spawned on the same location as their counterpart body, and
                    then a force is applied to it to have a dismemberment body explosion effect. The force is
                    calculated depending on the bullet’s location when it collides with the enemy. </p>

                <h5 class="text-muted">AI</h5>
                <p>I used the State Design Pattern to handle the AI states for the game. This is where each state is a
                    singleton class derived from an interface with 3 methods; Enter, Execute and Exit. Enemies have a
                    state variable that holds the current state. <br>
                    The first state the enemy will be in is the find weapon state. It searches the game for all the
                    active weapons and will then move towards the closest one. If the weapon is above the enemy, then
                    they’ll jump up. Once they’re next to the weapon, they will pick it up and then change to the
                    follow player state. <br>
                    In the follow player state, they will move towards the player’s position until the x difference is
                    within the certain value. If it is, then they will change states to the aiming state. <br>
                    In the aiming state, the enemy will gradually aim at the player using linear interpolation from its
                    current aiming position, to the player’s position. When the position of the aim is near the
                    player’s position, and the shooting delay has been reached, then the enemy will shoot.
                </p>

                <h5>What did I learn?</h5>
                <p>First, I learnt how to use the Box2D library and the core functionality of it, such as bodies,
                    drawing, fixtures, forces/impulses, movement and collision detection. It took a while to wrap my
                    head around it, but once I got it working with my game objects, it felt so good that I’ve
                    implemented physics into my own game.</p>
                <p> Second, I learnt how to create a state system that doesn’t use just use booleans and enums. Using
                    the state design pattern allows me to structure my code a lot nicer where the enemy class won’t be
                    long filled with if conditions and the functionality in them.</p>
                <p> Overall, this assignment was a great learning experience, where there’s also a lot of things that I
                    could’ve done to make it better. Like every assignment ever, I always start them late. It’s fine
                    that I always complete them before, but when it comes to games, I don’t. The game may be completed,
                    but it has a lot of cut down features, so if I had started earlier, maybe even a week earlier, then
                    I probably could have finished the game that was visioned at the start.

                        <p>This is a space invaders clone that our tutor wanted us to make by following a set of
                            exercises. I wouldn’t say this is a game as it’s not fully feature complete, but it was an
                            upskilling exercise to prepare for the individual assignment.

                <h5>What did I learn?</h5>

                <p>
                    <b>SDL – </b>I learnt how to use the SDL library to handle user keyboard and controller input and
                    graphics
                    drawing to make a video game instead of using pre-built game engines such as Unity 3D.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Sound (FMOD) – </b>I also learnt how to implement sound effects into the game using the FMOD
                    library. I
                    had thought it would be hard to do, but it was quite easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Animated Sprites – </b>I learnt how to add animated sprites using sprite sheets. It was a bit
                    hard
                    coded with defining the x values for the animated sprite I used, but I could see how I could make
                    it robust by dividing it evenly using the length of one frame or getting the number of frames.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Object Pooling – </b>I learnt how to make and use object pools using arrays. This prevents
                    constant
                    memory allocation and deallocation which I can see how efficient it can be if used correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>C++ in general – </b>This had definitely upped my knowledge in C++ in areas such as arrays,
                    singletons,
                    pointers and OOP in C++.
                </p>

                        <h5 class="mt-4">What is it?</h5>
                        <p>This is the third and final assignment of the computer graphics course. We were tasked to
                            create a 3D scene that has a camera flying around the scene. I decided to make a helicopter
                            fly around an abandoned town full of zombies. And of course, you were able to shoot them
                            with rockets.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h5>Main Features and Implementation?</h5>
                <h5 class="text-muted">The Helicopter Model</h5>
                <p>The helicopter model consisted of glut solid cubes and one glu sphere for the body. Each
                    part of the helicopter had its own class that was all included in the main helicopter
                    class. This helicopter class handled the scaling and positions of where all the parts
                    should be using push and pop matrices. Some of the classes such as the tail had other
                    shapes included it in for the tail blade. It made sense in hierarchal modelling, which also
                    made things a lot easier, as if I were to move the tail, then the tail blade would also
                    move along with it.</p>
                <h5 class="text-muted">Movement</h5>
                <p>The forward movement of the helicopter is based on the tilt angle of the helicopter. So, pressing
                    the forward button will tilt the helicopter forward, and vice versa with the backwards key. This
                    felt similar to how games like Grand Theft Auto does their forward movements with helicopters, and
                    I was happy with it. Though, the other controls such as strafing and rotating left/right didn’t
                    feel the same as how the forward movement worked. </p>

                <h5 class="text-muted">Shooting</h5>
                <p>One of the main features were shooting rockets. The rockets were spawned using an object pool
                    managed by the helicopter class. When shot, the rocket would have an applied velocity, and an angle
                    the same as the helicopter when it was shot. When collided with the ground, buildings or the
                    boundaries of the map, the rocket would spawn an explosion. The explosion would interpolate in size
                    and detect collision for zombies using bounding spheres. </p>

                <h5 class="text-muted">Zombies</h5>
                <p>Zombies were modelled with just two glut solid cubes. One for the body, and one for the head. The
                    head was textured with a stone wall, and coloured green. The zombies were managed like a particle
                    system where if they died, they would respawn somewhere random in the map. The AI was very simple,
                    as they would just walk in a single direction, and when contact with a wall, they would walk the
                    opposite direction. </p>

                <h5>What did I learn?</h5>
                <p>The main thing that I learnt from this project is how to manually apply textures onto a box object.
                    As the helicopter model had a lot of hierarchal modelling, my knowledge and understanding in push
                    and pop matrices grew. </p>

                        <h5 class="mt-4">What is it?</h5>
                        <p>This was the second assignment for the computer graphics course. It focused on 3D models,
                            hierarchal modelling and camera movement in 3D space.</p>

                        <h5>Main Features and Implementation?</h5>
                        <h5 class="text-muted">Camera Movement</h5>
                        <p>The camera movement was the hardest part because moving forwards must take account where the
                            camera is looking at. I took the hard approach and decided to learn about forward vectors
                            and all that cross-product stuff when I could’ve just applied simple trigonometry..</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h5 class="text-muted">Push and Pop Matrix</h5>
                <p>OpenGL had this nice push and pop matrix feature that allowed for hierarchal modelling. It was
                    easily to understand and implement but is very useful. All the planets revolved around the Sun, so
                    they were all in the push matrix of the Sun’s position. Earth had a moon and mars had two, so the
                    moons were in their push matrices respectively. </p>
                <h5>What did I learn?</h5>
                <p>I learnt how hard it was to implement movement based on the looking angle than what Unity or other
                    game engines already does for you. Same goes for the hierarchal modelling. In Unity, it’s just a
                    list of objects and dragging and dropping other objects into it. It’s also a lot more
                    time-consuming placing objects where you want it to be, as it is all done by code, but it makes you
                    more understandable of the low-level stuff instead of having game engines do it all for you.</p>

                        <h5 class="mt-4">What is this?</h5>
                        <p>This was the first assignment for our Computer Graphics course. It wasn’t really a game, but
                            it quite similar to making one. We were tasked to create a 2D animated scene that included
                            mandatory features such as randomly generated terrain and the features listed at the top in
                            the image. The missile was an optional feature.</p>

                        <h5>What were the main features and how did I implement them?</h5>
                        <h5 class="text-muted">The Asteroids</h5>
                        <p>The asteroids were spawned by a particle system that randomly chose a position on the screen
                            and spawned them. It kept track of “dead” particles and would respawn them to conserve
                            memory. The asteroids had its own class that generated a random shape and colour when
                            created. I had tried to replicate Unity’s Vector2 and velocity system by creating my own
                            Vector2 class and implementing the methods that helped with the movement of the asteroids.
                            To get the asteroids to move, they had a Vector2 velocity, Vector2 position and a gravity
                            scale to make them fall.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h5 class="text-muted">The Missile</h5>
                <p>The missile launcher also acted like a particle system that spawned the missiles. They spawned with
                    a random angle, and with a bit of trigonometry, the Vector2 velocity could be calculated to send
                    the missile into that direction. For collision detection, I created a bounds class that was very
                    similar to Unity’s bounds class. It had the min and max values for the x and y which is basically a
                    box. The class also had a method to check if the bounds was inside other bounds using the bound box
                    collision method. So, the asteroids and missiles all had a bounds object each and used an n2 method
                    to check each missile within each asteroid, which is pretty inefficient, but for a project this
                    small was fine. </p>
                <h5>What did I learn?</h5>
                <p>I pretty much learnt the basics on how to render and animate 2D shapes using just a programming
                    language (Java) and a library framework (OpenGL). It puts it into perspective of how much game
                    engines such as Unity already does for you. I also learnt about the drawing and process methods
                    that helped me a lot when I moved onto C++ and SDL.</p>

                            <h5 class="mt-4">What is Meteor?</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">Meteor is an endless 2D mobile game where the player must swipe
                                the
                                falling meteorites away from the village. The game was a team project consisting of
                                5
                                team members and was developed in Unity and C#..</p>

                        <div class="col-md">
                            <h5>What did I work on?</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">I worked on the spawning of the meteorites, the touch
                                functionality
                                and the explosion effects..</p>

                            <h5 class="text-muted">Spawning</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">For the spawning, I had used an invisible collision box and placed
                                it
                                somewhere above the screen. Unity’s collision components provided a bounds object
                                that
                                has the min and max x and y position of the box. So, with this, I was able to
                                randomise
                                a location inside the box where I could spawn the meteorite every few seconds. When
                                meteorites were spawned, using Vector maths, I was able to randomise an angle and
                                apply
                                the force to the meteorite, so they would come down at different angles.</p>
                        </div>



                    </div>

                    <h5 class="text-muted">Touch Controls</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Unity also provided handy functions for detecting touch, and with the
                        scripting API, it wasn’t so hard to get used to. Finding tutorials online for swipes
                        was a lot different than what we wanted. They were all mostly about detecting the
                        initial position of the touch, then the position of the release of the touch, use
                        trigonometry to identify the angle, then apply a force. The problem was this, is that
                        there was a slight delay from when you touched the meteorite, to when you swiped it
                        across, which is a big issue, because the meteorites fall quite fast and we wanted
                        instant feedback for the touches. So, I had the idea of applying a force to meteorite
                        that was touched towards the current position of the finger. To make it easier to touch
                        the meteorites, when touching the screen, a circular hitbox would spawn, so a meteorite
                        within the touch box in the initial touch would be the one with the applied force. I
                        then set a timer to a short delay that would disable the touch box, so the meteorite
                        wasn’t able to follow the touch infinitely. I also calculate the distance between the
                        initial touch position, and the current touch position so that if you swipe faster,
                        then the meteorite will fling faster. Though, this require a lot of testing until we
                        finally found values that we were happy with.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-muted">Explosion Effects</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The explosion effect was broken up into two parts. The particle explosion,
                        and
                        the shatter effect of the village. The particle explosion was pretty much a copy and paste
                        of a
                        tutorial I found online, but with modified shapes and colours to fit the game, or at least
                        tried to. For the shatter effect, I had cut up the sprite into pieces of the village that
                        another team member has made. Each of the sprites had physics enabled to them, parented to
                        an
                        empty game object, then created as a prefab. So when the meteorites make contact with the
                        village, then the original village would destroy itself, and the new prefab we made would
                        be
                        spawned with forces applied to them, as well as the particle explosion.</p>

                    <h5>What did I learn from this project?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">This was the first Unity game I have worked on and completed. It was also
                        the
                        first game I have worked on (for more than a few hours) and the first game I have worked on
                        with a team, so there was a lot to take in. As described earlier with what I worked on, I
                        pretty much learnt the basics of Unity and other game development things such as Vectors
                        and
                        update functions.<br><br>
                        I also learnt how it was like to work on a game with a team as well as the tools needed to
                        collaboratively work on a project. For the course that this project was a part of, we were
                        taught the scrum agile methodology that helped us communicate effectively as a team. The
                        tool
                        that we used to version control our project was GitHub. We learnt very quickly that GitHub
                        did
                        not work too well with Unity as the merge conflicts with scenes were really tedious to fix.

                        <h5 class="mt-4">What is it?</h5>
                        <p>This mobile game is similar to Angry Birds (Rovio Entertainment, 2009), but instead of being
                            the
                            one attacking, you are the one defending. <br>
                            You must try to defend your structure from getting demolished from the enemy cannons by
                            shooting projectiles at the cannon balls. Each ammo type has a special ability that the
                            player can activate after shooting. One of the abilities that have been implemented is the
                            ability to slow down time, as well as being able to redirect the projectile again after
                            shooting it once.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h5>Main Features and Implementation</h5>
                <h5 class="text-muted">Enemy Cannon (Aiming and Shooting)</h5>
                <p>The enemy cannon randomly selects a piece of structure present in the scene. It then selects a
                    random point within that single selected structure. It then chooses a random angle to shoot from,
                    but the angle is restricted so that it won’t be aiming behind. With the angle, it uses the
                    equations of motions (acceleration, velocity-time, displacement-time and velocity-displacement)
                    (The Physics Hypertextbook, n.d.) to calculate the amount of force needed to apply to the cannon
                    ball so that it will hit the point of the structure it had selected.</p>
                <br>The enemy cannon also uses a simple state machine by using boolean variables.
                <h5 class="text-muted">The Player Cannon (Shooting)</h5>
                <p>Shooting in this game works very similar to Angry Birds (Rovio Entertainment, 2009) where the player
                    must touch and drag the screen, and then release to shoot. The difference is that the player can
                    initially touch anywhere on the screen. The cannon has a maximum force that will be applied to the
                    shot projectile and is determined by calculating the length of the point of the initial touch and
                    the point of the last touch as the player let go of the screen. This is done by calculating the
                    difference of both vector2 positions, and then calculating the magnitude of the difference.</p>

                <h5 class="text-muted">The Special Ability</h5>
                <p>When the player touches the right side of the screen after shooting a projectile, it will activate
                    the projectile’s ability. The ability (the only one implemented) will slow down time and allow the
                    player to reshoot the projectile from its current position. The shooting works exactly the same as
                    if it were shooting from the cannon. Slowing down the time is as simple as lowering the time scale.
                    If the projectile hits an enemy projectile, then they are able to activate the ability once more.
                    However, if the projectile touches the surface, then they can no longer use it. This is done by
                    having a simple charge count where the count decrements when contact with anything but the enemy
                    projectiles and incrementing if it does touch the enemy projectiles. </p>

                <h5>What did I learn?</h5>
                <p>Basic vector maths and trigonometry. I will never forget: Vector2 difference = Vector2 b – Vector2
                    a. That difference holds a lot of information such as the distance between two vectors and the
                    angle.
                    I would also say I learnt those physics equations from the enemy cannon, but it’s been so long that
                    I’ve forgotten how it works.
