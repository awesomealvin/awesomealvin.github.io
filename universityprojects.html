                            <p class="card-text">Meteor is an endless 2D mobile game where the player must swipe the
                                falling meteorites away from the village. The game was a team project consisting of 5
                                team members and was developed in Unity and C#..</p>

                            <h5>What did I work on?</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">I worked on the spawning of the meteorites, the touch functionality
                                and the explosion effects..</p>

                            <h5 class="text-muted">Spawning</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">For the spawning, I had used an invisible collision box and placed it
                                somewhere above the screen. Unity’s collision components provided a bounds object that
                                has the min and max x and y position of the box. So, with this, I was able to randomise
                                a location inside the box where I could spawn the meteorite every few seconds. When
                                meteorites were spawned, using Vector maths, I was able to randomise an angle and apply
                                the force to the meteorite, so they would come down at different angles.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="text-muted">Touch Controls</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Unity also provided handy functions for detecting touch, and with the
                        scripting API, it wasn’t so hard to get used to. Finding tutorials online for swipes
                        was a lot different than what we wanted. They were all mostly about detecting the
                        initial position of the touch, then the position of the release of the touch, use
                        trigonometry to identify the angle, then apply a force. The problem was this, is that
                        there was a slight delay from when you touched the meteorite, to when you swiped it
                        across, which is a big issue, because the meteorites fall quite fast and we wanted
                        instant feedback for the touches. So, I had the idea of applying a force to meteorite
                        that was touched towards the current position of the finger. To make it easier to touch
                        the meteorites, when touching the screen, a circular hitbox would spawn, so a meteorite
                        within the touch box in the initial touch would be the one with the applied force. I
                        then set a timer to a short delay that would disable the touch box, so the meteorite
                        wasn’t able to follow the touch infinitely. I also calculate the distance between the
                        initial touch position, and the current touch position so that if you swipe faster,
                        then the meteorite will fling faster. Though, this require a lot of testing until we
                        finally found values that we were happy with.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="text-muted">Explosion Effects</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The explosion effect was broken up into two parts. The particle explosion, and
                        the shatter effect of the village. The particle explosion was pretty much a copy and paste of a
                        tutorial I found online, but with modified shapes and colours to fit the game, or at least
                        tried to. For the shatter effect, I had cut up the sprite into pieces of the village that
                        another team member has made. Each of the sprites had physics enabled to them, parented to an
                        empty game object, then created as a prefab. So when the meteorites make contact with the
                        village, then the original village would destroy itself, and the new prefab we made would be
                        spawned with forces applied to them, as well as the particle explosion.</p>

                    <h5>What did I learn from this project?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">This was the first Unity game I have worked on and completed. It was also the
                        first game I have worked on (for more than a few hours) and the first game I have worked on
                        with a team, so there was a lot to take in. As described earlier with what I worked on, I
                        pretty much learnt the basics of Unity and other game development things such as Vectors and
                        update functions.<br><br>
                        I also learnt how it was like to work on a game with a team as well as the tools needed to
                        collaboratively work on a project. For the course that this project was a part of, we were
                        taught the scrum agile methodology that helped us communicate effectively as a team. The tool
                        that we used to version control our project was GitHub. We learnt very quickly that GitHub did
                        not work too well with Unity as the merge conflicts with scenes were really tedious to fix.
