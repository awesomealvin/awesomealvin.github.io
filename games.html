                            <p class="card-text">Meteor is an endless 2D mobile game where the player must swipe
                                the
                                falling meteorites away from the village. The game was a team project consisting of
                                5
                                team members and was developed in Unity and C#..</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="col-md">
                            <h5>What did I work on?</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">I worked on the spawning of the meteorites, the touch
                                functionality
                                and the explosion effects..</p>

                            <h5 class="text-muted">Spawning</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">For the spawning, I had used an invisible collision box and placed
                                it
                                somewhere above the screen. Unity’s collision components provided a bounds object
                                that
                                has the min and max x and y position of the box. So, with this, I was able to
                                randomise
                                a location inside the box where I could spawn the meteorite every few seconds. When
                                meteorites were spawned, using Vector maths, I was able to randomise an angle and
                                apply
                                the force to the meteorite, so they would come down at different angles.</p>
                        </div>



                    </div>

                    <h5 class="text-muted">Touch Controls</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Unity also provided handy functions for detecting touch, and with the
                        scripting API, it wasn’t so hard to get used to. Finding tutorials online for swipes
                        was a lot different than what we wanted. They were all mostly about detecting the
                        initial position of the touch, then the position of the release of the touch, use
                        trigonometry to identify the angle, then apply a force. The problem was this, is that
                        there was a slight delay from when you touched the meteorite, to when you swiped it
                        across, which is a big issue, because the meteorites fall quite fast and we wanted
                        instant feedback for the touches. So, I had the idea of applying a force to meteorite
                        that was touched towards the current position of the finger. To make it easier to touch
                        the meteorites, when touching the screen, a circular hitbox would spawn, so a meteorite
                        within the touch box in the initial touch would be the one with the applied force. I
                        then set a timer to a short delay that would disable the touch box, so the meteorite
                        wasn’t able to follow the touch infinitely. I also calculate the distance between the
                        initial touch position, and the current touch position so that if you swipe faster,
                        then the meteorite will fling faster. Though, this require a lot of testing until we
                        finally found values that we were happy with.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-muted">Explosion Effects</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The explosion effect was broken up into two parts. The particle explosion,
                        and
                        the shatter effect of the village. The particle explosion was pretty much a copy and paste
                        of a
                        tutorial I found online, but with modified shapes and colours to fit the game, or at least
                        tried to. For the shatter effect, I had cut up the sprite into pieces of the village that
                        another team member has made. Each of the sprites had physics enabled to them, parented to
                        an
                        empty game object, then created as a prefab. So when the meteorites make contact with the
                        village, then the original village would destroy itself, and the new prefab we made would
                        be
                        spawned with forces applied to them, as well as the particle explosion.</p>

                    <h5>What did I learn from this project?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">This was the first Unity game I have worked on and completed. It was also
                        the
                        first game I have worked on (for more than a few hours) and the first game I have worked on
                        with a team, so there was a lot to take in. As described earlier with what I worked on, I
                        pretty much learnt the basics of Unity and other game development things such as Vectors
                        and
                        update functions.<br><br>
                        I also learnt how it was like to work on a game with a team as well as the tools needed to
                        collaboratively work on a project. For the course that this project was a part of, we were
                        taught the scrum agile methodology that helped us communicate effectively as a team. The
                        tool
                        that we used to version control our project was GitHub. We learnt very quickly that GitHub
                        did
                        not work too well with Unity as the merge conflicts with scenes were really tedious to fix.

                        <h5 class="mt-4">What is this?</h5>
                        <p>This was the first assignment for our Computer Graphics course. It wasn’t really a game, but
                            it quite similar to making one. We were tasked to create a 2D animated scene that included
                            mandatory features such as randomly generated terrain and the features listed at the top in
                            the image. The missile was an optional feature.</p>

                        <h5>What were the main features and how did I implement them?</h5>
                        <h5 class="text-muted">The Asteroids</h5>
                        <p>The asteroids were spawned by a particle system that randomly chose a position on the screen
                            and spawned them. It kept track of “dead” particles and would respawn them to conserve
                            memory. The asteroids had its own class that generated a random shape and colour when
                            created. I had tried to replicate Unity’s Vector2 and velocity system by creating my own
                            Vector2 class and implementing the methods that helped with the movement of the asteroids.
                            To get the asteroids to move, they had a Vector2 velocity, Vector2 position and a gravity
                            scale to make them fall.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h5 class="text-muted">The Missile</h5>
                <p>The missile launcher also acted like a particle system that spawned the missiles. They spawned with
                    a random angle, and with a bit of trigonometry, the Vector2 velocity could be calculated to send
                    the missile into that direction. For collision detection, I created a bounds class that was very
                    similar to Unity’s bounds class. It had the min and max values for the x and y which is basically a
                    box. The class also had a method to check if the bounds was inside other bounds using the bound box
                    collision method. So, the asteroids and missiles all had a bounds object each and used an n2 method
                    to check each missile within each asteroid, which is pretty inefficient, but for a project this
                    small was fine. </p>
                <h5>What did I learn?</h5>
                <p>I pretty much learnt the basics on how to render and animate 2D shapes using just a programming
                    language (Java) and a library framework (OpenGL). It puts it into perspective of how much game
                    engines such as Unity already does for you. I also learnt about the drawing and process methods
                    that helped me a lot when I moved onto C++ and SDL.</p>

                        <h5 class="mt-4">What is it?</h5>
                        <p>This was the second assignment for the computer graphics course. It focused on 3D models,
                            hierarchal modelling and camera movement in 3D space.</p>

                        <h5>Main Features and Implementation?</h5>
                        <h5 class="text-muted">Camera Movement</h5>
                        <p>The camera movement was the hardest part because moving forwards must take account where the
                            camera is looking at. I took the hard approach and decided to learn about forward vectors
                            and all that cross-product stuff when I could’ve just applied simple trigonometry..</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h5 class="text-muted">Push and Pop Matrix</h5>
                <p>OpenGL had this nice push and pop matrix feature that allowed for hierarchal modelling. It was
                    easily to understand and implement but is very useful. All the planets revolved around the Sun, so
                    they were all in the push matrix of the Sun’s position. Earth had a moon and mars had two, so the
                    moons were in their push matrices respectively. </p>
                <h5>What did I learn?</h5>
                <p>I learnt how hard it was to implement movement based on the looking angle than what Unity or other
                    game engines already does for you. Same goes for the hierarchal modelling. In Unity, it’s just a
                    list of objects and dragging and dropping other objects into it. It’s also a lot more
                    time-consuming placing objects where you want it to be, as it is all done by code, but it makes you
                    more understandable of the low-level stuff instead of having game engines do it all for you.</p>
