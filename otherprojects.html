                        <h5 class="mt-4">What is it?</h5>
                        <p>This was probably the first completed application that I have made that is also actually
                            useful. It’s an external utility application for Counter-Strike Global Offensive (CSGO)
                            (Valve, 2012) that generates “buy binds” for their desired loadout that they have selected
                            in the application. The user can press the key they assigned the buy bind to, where it will
                            automatically purchase all the items they have selected. The “buy binds” is a generated
                            text that the user can paste into the CSGO console, or into their config file.
                        </p>

                <h5>Main Features and Implementation</h5>
                <h5 class="text-muted">UI</h5>
                <p>The UI was made by using Visual Studio’s drag and drop feature for windows forms. Each component was
                    assigned a function that gets called when clicked and a name to identify the purpose of the
                    component. The key selection menu also worked similar, and the layout was all drag and dropped to
                    match a regular keyboard.</p>
                <h5 class="text-muted">Generating the binds text</h5>
                <p>When components are selected, such as tick boxes, it will append the name of the item onto the end
                    of the copy text box. It was as simple as having lots of switch and if statements and could be
                    improved upon by using structs or classes, but I was very new to programming at that time and
                    didn’t know about those.</p>

                <h5 class="text-muted">Generating the cost</h5>
                <p>In the same switch or if statement when a component is selected, the price of the item will have
                    added to the total price of the loadout. This was just a nifty feature to let the user know how
                    much the loadout will cost.</p>

                <h5>What did I learn?</h5>
                <p>I was proud of this application after developing it because I found it very useful as I also used it
                    a lot. Yes, there were already tools like this online, but being able to make something that I can
                    use and not rely on someone else felt very accomplishing. This project was highly hard coded and
                    developed using the very old windows form. With the knowledge I have now, I could make this more
                    robust and even have it on the website instead of a windows application.
